            <h1 id="TheBeginning">The Emergence of Owen</h1>
            <h4>Arriving on Earth approximately 2.4 to 2.1 billion years ago during the “Snowball Earth” era, 
            Owen needed assistance to navigate the foreign land of Earth and had to learn how to fit in. 
            After only relying on the teleportation volunteers to survive for billions of years, Owen had 
            other species companions once the first humans arrived. The most wise humans guided Owen to fit in 
            with the basics of human civilization. These humans are designated as Owen’s Caretakers where 
            throughout human history, they had housed and sought after Owen while teaching valuable lessons 
            to him about humanity. These Caretakers passed on the responsibility of taking care of Owen throughout 
            several generations and societies. Only two generations are officially confirmed to be Owen’s Caretakers. 
            The most current generation of Owen’s Caretakers is the individual named Don Pham, who received Owen at a 
            retail store without prior knowledge of him before. Pham, with the assistance of his friend group, 
            sought after Owen and helped spread his messages of wisdom to society. The earliest generation of Owen’s 
            Caretakers is a United States mid-western Caucasian woman who had acquired the responsibility of looking 
            after Owen at an unknown date. Up until 2017, she helped adjust Owen into modern society and in return 
            received happiness from having Owen as a close companion. According to her own anecdotes, Owen was 
            received at a minimart as a valentines gift from her husband. It is unclear how Owen made it in a 
            mini-mart nor how Owen was passed on to the retail store Pham had received Owen from. </h4>

                <h4>Owen joined a branch of the Celestial Union Armed Forces known as the Galactic Marines. 
                    He was first deployed in the Planet of Inuwinski. There, his company was tasked for 
                    capturing a hill above the Inuwinese farms. Suddenly, at 29:78 AM, they were attacked 
                    by a suicide charge of rebel owls. Owen recalls that he saw one of his comrades had 
                    accidentally set off an hand held explosive and blew himself up. Owen had never seen 
                    such horrifying visuals before. Later that morning, his orders were to finally capture 
                    the hill. The battle began on 72:93 PM, Owen stated that when they first engaged the rebel
                    garrison on top of that hill, he could see his company commander yelling and rallying his
                    men to make a final push towards the hill. Under machine gun fire and artillery, they 
                    charged up the hill slaughtering the men stationed up that hill. Owen’s friend recalls 
                    that after they had finally captured the hill, they left no survivors. The raid of the 
                    night before caused casualties of 40 wounded, and 29 dead. Owen admits to killing a rebel
                    owl who surrendered. He could see the fear in his comrade next to him begging not to be
                    shot like the owl beside him. After a week of intense skirmishing of the hill, the 19th
                    Galactic Marines had successfully captured Planet Inuwinski.</h4>

                <h4>Owen only remembers seeing the naval bombardment of Planet Posjoki when looking from his space landing craft
                    They captured the hill since it was a large artillery position with a wide view of targets.
                    There was a debate back home where if the Invasion of Planet Inuwinski was tactically significant.
                    After Owen had fought in the Second Rebellion of the Anti-Talon regime. he then spent 13 years of his 
                    life in the rural areas of Planet Sitosoku. He was a farmer growing Sitosokan cucumbers and 
                    lameile. One day, he heard on the radio that the Confederation of Stellar Sphere had declared 
                    war on the Celestial Union. He immediately came back to serve and fight, after a severe war 
                    which left the Celestial Union occupied by the CSS, the military police began rounding up 
                    supporters and nationalists of former union and executed them. Among them was Owen’s former 
                    marines. An underground government was developing inter dimensional travel to escape 
                    the new regime and seek refuge. Owen was one of the volunteers to test the device used to 
                    travel and it worked, he was teleported into the dimension and planet as we know as Earth.</h4>

                <h4>Owen’s 2nd battle was in the Siege of Ejidie. The continent had been under siege for 
                    months and when Owen first landed near the coast, he could see the cities smoking. He 
                    could even see black clusters of the smog from space. His division was tasked with 
                    suppressing a suspected enemy break of the siege on the east of the city Kwaineseli. 
                    They waited outside of the city, digging trenches and building fortifications. It 
                    started to rain and the mud caused most of the trenches to be flooded. Owen said they 
                    still had to wait there. After a week of constant rain and windy weather, they spotted 
                    a group of enemy scouts. Owen remembered the yelling that caused a panic that they were 
                    finally attacking. Then, he could see a large crowd of rebel owls charging at them when 
                    they realized they were spotted. The marines opened fire. Owen could remember that they 
                    were making screeching sounds, it slightly terrified him seeing these enemies were 
                    probably weary of the siege and did not care if they died anymore. The rebels finally 
                    reached the trenches and they fought in hand to hand combat. The commander called a 
                    retreat to the woods in the West. They heard the rebels celebrating after finally 
                    breaking the siege in 7 months.</h4>

                            <li><em>DO NOT ATTEMPT TO ATTACK:</em> You will always lose in a fight to a hatchling. These bots are highly trained in the art of war and can easily kill a normal human within seconds.</li><br>
                            <li><em>CALL AUTHORITIES OR AN OWL IMMEDIATELY:</em> Owls are the most responsible actors to deactivate these monsters. It is by default that Owls know how to deprogram a hatchling in the event they're in contact with them.</li><br>
                            <li><em>CALM AT ALL TIMES AND HIDE UNTIL AID ARRIVES:</em>  hatchlings can sense fear. Their eyes will turn red and will immediately become hostile at the sight of it. Find somewhere safe to hide such as a closet and stay calm until the necessary help arrives</li><br>

                        Follow these procedures and you are sure to secure yourself from any potential danger these robotic owls may cause. Remember! <a class="why">Stop, Drop, and Call!</a>

                    the Owen of our reality is an exception from most other universes, as it is the norm for Owen to usually either be defeated, dead, 
                    or distorted in some way. Under the research of Brownie it was discovered that there exist an organization of alternate surviving 
                    Owen's fighting to keep what's left of the remaining Owen's alive. This and all other realities of alternate Owens is the tree of 
                    infinite branches known as the Owenverse</h3>

                    to the group, giving him the name [REDACTED]. The css began their conquest of the owl race using their new army of genetically modified owls, with it getting to a point where 
                    owls were either left dead or forced to join the css as experiments. The sheer power of Project O.W.L became so bad that Owen Chungus and Owen called a temporary truce to defeat Project O.W.L which shortly ended as Owen Chungus tried to backstab Owen but then soon after got fucking disintegrate by [REDACTED]. Owen attempted to make a last stand 
                    against the css but it failed, with [REDACTED] obtaining the last of his abilities. 
                    This universe has been placed on watch for intervention by the Owl Society to stop [REDACTED] from spreading across the Owenverse. also in this timeline Timmy has a cool hat.

                    leads to Owen Chungus joining the invading army. Owen works with the Russians to beat back the advance, leading to Owen and the Russians becoming close allies. After 
                    the death of Tsar Nicolas the 1st, the Russian upper class as well as the general public regard him in such a heroic and sacred light that Owen is crowned the new Tsar
                     of Russia. Owen Chungus makes himself the center of western European society as a God lime deity, forcing Europeans to send in men as tribute to rot in Chungus Hell. 
                     Europe becomes split into 2 worlds, a slavic/owl kingdom ruled by Owen from the east and Owen Chungus literally just  holding influence in the majority of western Europe

                     workers  begin plotting revolution against Tsar Owen, the Owl society is trying to gain the resources needed to retrieve Tsar Owen before he is overthrown and maybe even

                    In other news Owen Chungus gets so sad and bored over how his nemesis died he just works at a Owlbucks across from Santiago. Maybe someday he'll be manager with enough hard work

                    The Chungus Infection released as a bioweapon by Owen Chungus takes a turn as the chemical, which was supposed to simply make victims drop dead in mass, ended up turning millions

                    to other cases as he attempted to fight off the infection, but alas it's effects were too strong and he eventually succumb to it. Since Owen Chungus is a massive moron he 
                    did not plan for thr zombie outbreak and was left defenseless against the horde, almost getting infected himself. He now had an uneasy truce with Oliver, who has had it 
                    rough surviving on his own since Owen's infection. Together, the duo attempt to make it across the wasteland to find some type of reminent of society as they escape the

                    After decades of fighting, the world is under the reign of a newly changed CSS under the rule of Cyborg Owen, or Cyborgwen, who had destroyed the original leaders way 
                    back in order to use the groups resources for something more. The World is under the watch of the Robowls, technology advanced robot owls that fill in needs such as soldiers, 
                    workers, and professional class clowns. Cyborg Owen has far greater plans, especially with the barely living body of Owen Chungus captured in a container who appears to have been 
                    suffering for centuries, not recovering from an unknown battle. A group known as the Early Birds have attempted to revolt against the CSS, with their leader Oliver's main goal 
                    being to destroy Cyborg Owen and end their reign of terror. Cyborg Owen would also infiltrate another wasteland universe to create the Owl Society, an elite group of Owens across 
                    the Owenverse fighting to maintain what's left of the surviving Owens. Something a bit more peculiar about this Owen is that he seems like he didn't come from this universe natively. 
                    His Cyborg parts appear to be over harsh wounds from a battle, and he appears to be filled with immense guilt over a string of unknown events. What had led this Owen to even be the 
                    first to escape his world and be struck with guilt remains to be answered. Strangely, Brownies whereabouts in this universe are also unknown, with it neither being confirmed or denied 
                    that Brownie is gone.
