            <h2>Oscar joined the branch in the Celestial Union Armed Forces called the Galactic Navy. Oscar was stationed in the GSN Dokoqi CV-7, a Holado Class carrier. 
                Oscar was navy pilot and flew the Eiden Model 102 torpedo bomber.  His first battle was the orbital campaign in Planet Powitz. The rebel navy heavily guarded 
                the planet from a Celestian invasion. Oscar’s torpedo squadron was tasked with intercepting an enemy task force. They launched at 19:37 and finally spotted the 
                enemy vessels. The squadron then engaged at 21:03. Oscar and his wingman began their torpedo run on an Clokosi class battleship. They dropped their torpedoes. 
                Oscar’s wingman’s torpedo swerved and missed the target. Oscar’s torpedo struck the starboard side. Oscar then pulls away and sees 3 other pilots flying Eiden 
                Model 306 Dive Bombers, nicknamed the “Screeching Wasp”. This is due to the aircraft creating a distinct eerie sound when diving on it’s targets. 3 of them 
                were diving down on the battleship and they dropped their payloads, 5 bombs hit while 4 others miss when it was steering to port side. He could see the ship 
                ablaze. Then, a monstrous explosive ripped her in half. The explosion came from her magazine. Oscar flew back to the carrier reporting that the the main 
                flagship of the task force had been sunk.</h2>
            <h2>Oscar remembers on the Powitz Campaign, his carrier called for general quarters. All the crewowls ran to their battle stations. They spotted 15 enemy rebel 
                aircraft, 7 of which were twin engined aircraft. The sky was then filled with anti air fire and flak. Oscar looked up and saw one of the aircraft running 
                parallel to Dokoqi. It dropped its payload and the carrier turned hard to port side to evade the incoming  bombs. However, Oscar could see the bombs still 
                lining up to the carrier almost as if they were “tracing” the carrier. He realized these were the rare weapons that the rebels had. This one was a bomb that 
                could change their direction so they have a better chance at hitting their target. Everyone braced for impact. Suddenly,  boom! 2 bombs had penetrated the 
                deck and blew up inside the hangar. Oscar then saw crewowls from the lower decks on fire. He could even see an aviation mechanic’s boot melted into his foot. 
                The Dokoqi was towed to port for repairs the next day. <em>--End Log--</em> </h2>

                Sam was drafted into the Celestial Union Army. He was deployed on the snowy planet of Rebomue. He was a tank gunner in a K26-65 Medium Tank. The first battle was an attempt to assault an enemy 
                airfield that was launching aircraft against the Galactic Navy orbiting the planet. The tanks were advancing and were followed by infantry. Soon, an enemy anti tank gun shot 
                Sam’s tank. Luckily, it bounced off. Sam later described it as a repeating headache every time those 65mm shells struck them. Then, he saw something in the midst of the snow. 
                He had spotted the the barrel of the anti tank gun. His commander order to turn the turret left by 37 degrees. The commander ordered an HE shell. Sam then fired the 76mm. He

            <h2>Oliver enlisted in the branch of the Celestial Union Armed Forces, known as the Galactic Army Air Service. His squadron was tasked to carpet bomb key 
                infrastructure such as munitions plants, factories, and naval ports located in the Northern Hemisphere of Inuwinski.  His first mission was the bomb the city of 
                Findoepi. This target had been in the eyes of the Celestial Union for a while as it is the main naval district and shipyard of the rebels. One early morning at 
                3:89, Oliver's squadron set off from the Planet Powitz. This was one of the largest air raids in Celestial Union's military history. A formation of about four 
                thousand Eiden O-36 heavy bombers was heading towards their target. However, there would be no fighters to escort them due to the long distance. next day later 
                at 13:62, they finally entered Inuwinski's stratosphere. They were descending until they were near two kilometers above Findoepi. The rebels had spotted them. 
                Suddenly, rebel flak erupted spontaneously. Civilians and sailors below would say that the bombers' shadows formed dark black clouds which blotted out the sun 
                above. The anti-air fire filled the air with smog and shrapnel. The flak was tearing the bombers apart. Oliver himself recounts witnessing a bomber was hit and 
                its entire left wing tore off, twirling down with a blazing trail. The shrapnel ripped the airframe apparently as if several soldiers from the outside fired at 
                the bombers with small arms fire. All of the sudden, the barrage of flak was silenced. Oliver recalls in training that a cease of anti-air fire meant enemy aircraft 
                will arriving to intercept them. Then in the corner of his eye, he saw an dozen rebel fighters. The bombers released a swarm of lead and tracers. The fighters zoomed
                 past Oliver as he tried to open fire on one. He ducked as he saw one with it's nose pointing straight at him. As he lifted his head, the third engine was smoking. 
                 The fighters then abruptly left. For a moment there was silence. <em>--End Log--</em></h2>

            <h2>
                Percy was born in the Bekino province, the famine-struck and impoverished underbelly of planet Inuwinski. His egg was kidnapped and raised by followers of the cult 
                “The Hoot’s Hand”, an organization sprouted in Bekino that saw following extremist interpretations of the Hoot’s scriptures as the remedy to the province’s issues. 
                Because of this, Percy was isolated for much of his childhood in the cult’s farming village, enduring much humiliation and emotional abuse from other indoctrinated 
                youths and leaders of the cult. With no one to keep him company, Percy had a falling out of his religion and packed his bags away from home at a young age.
            </h2>
            <h2>Around his time as a runaway, the CSS had begun their campaign to invade planet Inuwinski, dragging the entire planet into the war. This made Percy, reliant on whatever 
                money he was able to steal from the cult, struggle even more to live as food and supplies around him became more scarce. One day as Percy checked out of his motel, a 
                common routine for him from hopping town to town to leave Bekino, he encountered a military recruiter handing out fliers to the locals. He grabbed a flier which in exchange 
                for enlistment to the Galactic Forces, promised stable housing, income, and education. As the money he had left was not enough to leave Bekino entirely, he decided with 
                nothing to lose, he would take what he could get. 
            </h2>
            <h2>
                Percy’s severed connections with his past acquaintances made him distinct from the other applicants, especially towards recruiters of the clandestine Celestial Office of 
                Defense Agents (CODA). Thus, they offered Percy a position as an intelligence agent where he would receive proper housing and meals in CODA’s Bekino headquarters. 
                His time as an agent ranged from usual undercover espionage missions in CSS controlled cities, to more sensitive hostage exfiltration operations, and even in highly 
                classified cases such as the leaking of files pertaining to CSS’s Owl Defects. Although Percy gained respect from his peers for pulling off treacherous feats, he was 
                never awarded any intelligence medals and when there began to make plans to, disaster struck.
            </h2>
            <h2>
                News has gotten out that the CSS had breached Inuwinski’s capital city, toppling the planet’s leadership and legislature. Inuwinski now belongs to the CSS, and they 
                would begun reforming departments left and right. No exception was made for CODA and was transformed into a secret police to the CSS. Percy’s record of no awards 
                would turn out to be somewhat of a blessing, as officers who had awards were rounded up and executed to prevent loyalty to the Celestrial Union. Percy’s life would become 
                more miserable, having to surveil and raid citizens for following resistance movements and assassinate anyone deemed a threat by the CSS. Percy thought about turning to 
                religion again to sooth his unresting conscience, but his lingering trauma from childhood and the CSS’s censorship on religion prevented him from being so.
            </h2>
            <h2>
                Percy would live like this for a while, becoming internally depressed but forced to hide it from fear of the punishment for non-compliance. State media reported that the 
                Celestial Union had fallen to CSS hands, erasing the slim possibility of the CSS going away. At his quarters while trying to intoxicate himself with a bottle of Sitosokan 
                Rum, he received mail. It was the usual propaganda brochure, however several of the letters had handwritten markings that were definitely out of place. He recognized this 
                type of cypher from his time before the CSS and proceeded to decode it. It turned out to be a letter from his old director who was presumed dead from the department’s purges. 
                The director shared news that there was a teleportation experiment undergoing that would serve as a means of escape from the CSS. Familiar that Percy had a background of 
                keeping no ties, the director had recommended Percy to be a volunteer to the experiment and outlined instructions to enter the testing site. 
            </h2>
            <h2>
                Percy spared no time to prepare leaving, gathering as many clothes, food, and money that was in his quarters. Percy made his escape out of the CODA facility which, 
                unlike the farm he ran from, was clad with watch towers, trenches, and mine fields. Percy’s experience as a exfil agent would well prepare him and was able to 
                make his way to the experiment grounds. 
            </h2>
            <h2>
                In present day, Percy has made his way to our planet reuniting with fellow experiment volunteers. Percy has since reconnected with the teachings of the Hoot, this time under his own terms.

            <h2>Owl rescues are nothing uncommon within the Celestial Union, with kidnappings from CSS forces being a regular part of everyday life. However, the kidnapping of one Owl has 
            boggled the minds of thousands who have looked into the case. Oswald, the long lost twin brother of Oscar, is an inhabitant of the planet Earth, arriving there through 
            unknown means. He frequented the jungles and land of South East Asia, treating the area as his permanent home. On one night when venturing into the urban area of Ho Chi 
            Minh city, Oswald was kidnapped by Vietnamese smuggles. These smugglers operated gambling locations across Vietnam and parts of the US, and often had prizes for hardcore 
            gamblers. Oswald, who they assumed to be an ordinary plush owl, was shipped off to the US to be a part of a prize counter. Oswald spent many weeks on the sea, locked up 
            in a cold, desolate shipping container. When arriving in the ports of California, Oswald was transported in a van to an underground gambling site, trapped as a prize. 
            Oswald spent months like this, being unable to escape and confined to a small box, creating mental trauma and distress that he still struggles with today. The Celestial 
            Union gained knowledge of his whereabouts after an undercover agent found him on accident while on a surveillance mission to find CSS plants. The Union sent out a group 
            of experienced card counters, gamblers, and mathematicians to the underground casino and managed to win enough points to get Oswald. Ever since his rescue, Oswald has 
            spent the past year in a rehabilitation facility and has taken special “normal” pills to help him recover from the mental trauma he experienced at the capture site. 
            Oswald has yet to meet Oscar. <em>--End Log--</em></h2>
